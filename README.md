Baby experiment using the visual habituation paradigm

# This task is used to run a habituation paradigm.
During each trial the gaze of the participant is lured by a attention grabber.
The attention grabber is a series of pictures that mimics a movie of a
laughing baby. When a participant is looking to the grabber the experimenter
Presses a button to start the main part of the trial. In each trial the
baby is looking to a bulls eye stimulus and hears repeated words.
If the baby stops looking the experimenter presses a button and if the
experimenter doesn't cancel this action the trial will finish in 2 seconds.
During a trial the cumulative looking and not looking time is recorded.


## Habituation
In the habituation phase trials are presented as described above. After
the sixth trial on we examine whether the infant meets the habituation
criterion. This criterion is met once the mean cumulative looking time of the
last three trial is less then 65% of the first threesome. Once the criterion
is met the test phase is started.

## Test phase
Two trials are presented.

## Attention phase
One trial is presented with a completely deviant stimulus. Generally it is
expected that a attentive baby will exhibit an increase in looking time,
since a novel stimulus is interesting.

#finish
The experiment finishes after a happy song is played along with some infant
friendly pictures.
